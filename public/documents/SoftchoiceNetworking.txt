DATA QUALITY AND ENGINEERING
Overview of team: 
- In terms of data engineering, team is responsible for compiling and preparing data for reports, manipulating and restructuring data on a request basis. Team uses PowerBI to manage the OTC model that stores all the data of Softchoice. Team works on a two-week sprint schedule, where every two Wednesdays, updates are deployed to the system and a new sprint starts. Team also have daily scrum meetings to discuss progress of all active tickets.
- In terms of data science, team provides data analysis for specific projects to provide insights into business value and efficiency. This however doesn't occupy much of the total work. An example would be an investigation into whether a correlation between NPS and customer revenue (spoiler alert: no, there is no correlation).

Bob's responsibilities:
- Resolve tickets/stories by coordinating with business owners to learn about requirements and help suggest solutions
- Work on data analysis/data science projects

Some interesting projects/stories that Bob worked on (and the lessons):
- A good first task is one that touchs upon as many parts of the system as possible. This helps you gain a whole picture and later on when other tickets come in, you can quickly identify a possible solution, even suggest a better solution and understand how each small part connects to create the large system. This also helps when business owners do not have a clear idea of how they want things to work, now you can tap into your knowledge and make some suggestions. (You should ask your manager for a ticket like this in the beginning!)
- Service is a top priority. A correct solution is not always the solution we should take. Bob used to work on a ticket where business owner loses all the data by refreshing the connection before a new fiscal year starts. Instead of going with the original solution which is to build a table that stores the beginning of fiscal year for all teams (note that this could be a year-long task), Bob provided the data directly to business owner, because that's the end goal.
- One of the current projects Bob is working on is supervisor reporting, this is to resolve the issue of managers are not being rolled to their own teams.
- In the beginning, it's a good idea to have a senior in the team to guide you through a story, espcially how they investigate to find out the issue and how they come up with a solution. More often than not this turns out to be quite an easy task for senior members, and you learn a lot as new members. You also understand better how to communicate and ask the right questions to business owners.

Bob's academic experience:
- Future plans: Graduation is due next June. Most likely will go for a Master's degree, or even a PhD.
- Recommended courses for machine learning: STAC67, STAC62, Multivariate Analysis
- Recommended clubwork: AMACSS


COMMUNICATION AND PORTFOLIO MARKETING
Overview of team:
- Manager (Amanda) + two freelance designers + co-op student (Soham)

Soham's responsibilties:
- Work on design requests from different departments/teams for different purposes
- Tools that Soham used for work: Asana to process requests and communicate with manager/stakeholders, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Indesign for design
- Products that Soham worked on: graphics for social media posts, Google ads, datasheets/infographics
- Requests go through manager for scoping, Soham works on the requests, requests go for internal review with manager, stakeholder review with requesters, and translation team for conversion into French

Soham's opinion on the position:
- Pro: get to be creative, figure out how to incorporate her own input into the requirements 
- Con: work is mostly independent, there is limited team communication and interaction

Soham's highlight project:
Google adverts, because it's quite different from what she's worked on so far. There was some difficulty converting to the required dimensions while maintaining the content/elements.

Soham's background:
- 2nd work term, 4th year in Business Administration - Marketing at TMU
- No plan of going for a Master's degree since Soham thinks it's more important in marketing to have experience than to have high qualifications
