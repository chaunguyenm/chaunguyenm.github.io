        I&apos;m a Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of
        Toronto Scarborough. I love reading documentations and getting completely
        lost in lingo, getting assigned tasks slightly out of my capacity just
        to keep myself on my toes and (most importantly) indulging myself in
        an unhealthy amount of sleep, foods and karaoke.
